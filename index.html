                    <h1>Zero Search Engine</h1>
                    <p>This is a demo of the Zero Search Engine. Please note that it is a work-in-progress, so expect to experience occasional errors and malfunctions. And please excuse the extremely bad-looking website; it will be greatly improved and redesigned in the future.</p>
                    <p>Zero is being developed by BrightSky OSSDO.</p>
                    <h2>Known Problems</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only US-based websites have been crawled. This makes the search engine quite incomplete.</li>
                        <li>The search algorithm is still in development. You may occasionally see results that don't match your search query at all (although this is a rare occurrence).</li>
                        <li>Due to the way web crawling works, you may sometimes see a search result that is simply another search engine containing your query. But again, this is quite rare.</li>
                        <li>Bugs and glitches sometimes occur when parsing the metadata of a search result.</li>
                        <li>Attempting to include "<code>?search=</code>" in your search query will cause issues because it is a phrase reserved by Zero for parsing your search.</li>
                        <li>The page might break if you try to search for a really long word without spaces.</li>
                        <li>Search queries are limited to 200 characters.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>Your search - <b id="searchTerm"></b> - did not match any documents.</p>
            <p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure all words are spelled correctly.</li>
                <li>Try different keywords.</li>
                <li>Try more general keywords.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind the known problems outlined on Zero's main page.</li>
